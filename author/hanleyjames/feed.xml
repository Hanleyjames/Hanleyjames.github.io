      <content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/new-years-nietzsche">&lt;p&gt;Happy New Years everyone,
I wanted to lay out a general goal for me and re-read through some of the Kaufmann translations of Nietzsche. I had seen some newer distaste for Nietzsche arise and realize it has been close to a decade since I read his works. I am going to start with Thus Spoke and read through the others in chronological order. I would like to afterwords spend some time reading and exploring newer academic critiques of his works. I feel like a lot has changed in 10 years, including peoples attitudes towards Nietzsche.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

&lt;p&gt;During the process of migrating Cloud Flows from Dynamics to Salesforce I ran into an issue with data transformation that caused me to look at as many approaches possible. One was transforming 15 &amp;amp; 18 digit SF UIDs to GUIDs. The other was how to do this with minimal modifications to an already existing api endpoint if possible. After a few discussions around having a Flow do heavy lifting and not wanting to work with Functions, I came to spend some time looking at taking advantage of a unique feature of Connectors.
I had never been in a position to look into creating a Connector. To me they’re just something you use to retrieve data in a way that allows someone with minimal experience to apply filters and so on. It turns out that you can also just run C# code. I did not spot a lot of articles or information about this, and the few that did it seems to be a rare use. If for some reason you need to do a bit of heavy lifting and want to keep your work inside of Power Automate and your code is less than 1MB and runs in less than 5 seconds, then this is for you. If you would like to check out Microsoft’s documentation, you can follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/write-code&quot;&gt;the link here&lt;/a&gt;.
I am still going to cover the steps here in a future update.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
