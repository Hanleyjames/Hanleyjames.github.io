        <title>JS Malware Obsfucation</title>
        
          <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;obfuscation&quot;&gt;Obfuscation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An integral part of malware development or at least trying to figure it out centers around a practice called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation_(software)&quot;&gt;Obfuscation&lt;/a&gt;. Obfuscation is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/obfuscation#English&quot;&gt;‘[t]he alteration of computer code to preserve its behavior while concealing its structure and intent’.&lt;/a&gt;. Deobfuscation is the process of turning unreadable, or comically obscure code into something readable. To me, the practice of doing it in Javascript is interesting because it seems like the last language you would want to use if you’re developing malware. Out of this line of thinking, I wanted to spend time exploring how JS malware operates and how people use JS to infect machines.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Years and Re-reading Nietzsche</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy New Years everyone,
I wanted to lay out a general goal for me and re-read through some of the Kaufmann translations of Nietzsche. I had seen some newer distaste for Nietzsche arise and realize it has been close to a decade since I read his works. I am going to start with Thus Spoke and read through the others in chronological order. I would like to afterwords spend some time reading and exploring newer academic critiques of his works. I feel like a lot has changed in 10 years, including peoples attitudes towards Nietzsche.&lt;/p&gt;
