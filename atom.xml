        <title>New Years and Re-reading Nietzsche</title>
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy New Years everyone,
I wanted to lay out a general goal for me and re-read through some of the Kaufmann translations of Nietzsche. I had seen some newer distaste for Nietzsche arise and realize it has been close to a decade since I read his works. I am going to start with Thus Spoke and read through the others in chronological order. I would like to afterwords spend some time reading and exploring newer academic critiques of his works. I feel like a lot has changed in 10 years, including peoples attitudes towards Nietzsche.&lt;/p&gt;
